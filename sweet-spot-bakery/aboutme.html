<h1>About our Sweet Spot</h1>
<img src="SS_logo.png" alt="SS Bakery Logo" width="20%" height="20%">

<p>Baking is more than just a hobby: it's a love language. <i>That's why we aim to spread our love with what we make.</i></p>
<p>The Sweet Spot is a passion project, and the development of it was carefully crafted over 3 years. With the experience of 
our bakers, lead home baker and hobbyist Jane Doe, and all other treasured members of our small team, we've made big strides.
We can't thank our patrons enough, and want to keep working hard for the satisfaction of our customers!</p>
